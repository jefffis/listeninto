If you&rsquo;re a fan of stripped down garage rock, loud drums, and/or redheads, **meet your perfect match**. Formed on April 20th, 2008; White Mystery have been melting ears ever since. They draw their inspiration from visual art, being on the road often (& presumably seeing weird shit), collective daydreaming, and some of the bands below. But why the name White Mystery? As Alex herself describes it: &ldquo;Because we&rsquo;re sweet and mysterious, like the Airheads candy.&rdquo;

She also likens their music to a Chicago-style hot dog; because &ldquo;the magic is between the buns.&rdquo; Some of her musical influences are **The MC5, Marc Bolan of T.Rex, Tina Turner, and Poison Ivy of the Cramps**.

<!--When White Mystery is not cranking out new tunes, they enjoy playing games and partying.-->

White Mystery has toured worldwide, and earned rave reviews from <a href="https://www.mtv.com/artists/white-mystery/" target="_blank">MTV</a>, <a href="https://noisey.vice.com/ja/blog/white-mystery-premieres-their-toxic-sugar-music-video" target="_blank">VICE</a>, <a href="https://www.wbez.org/story/wbez-blog/white-mystery-performs-sound-opinions" target="_blank">Sound Opinions</a>, <a href="https://pitchfork.com/tv/33-station-to-station/995-white-mystery/" target="_blank">Pitchfork</a> &ndash; and currently represent the <a href="https://www.whitemysteryband.com/2014/03/18/levis-equipped-white-mystery/" target="_blank">Levi&rsquo;s #equipped</a> campaign.
