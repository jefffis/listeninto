    - song: Teen Line
      info: 'Anytime Sabrina puts this on at a party people think they&rsquo;re Blondie but they&rsquo;re not! This is an under the radar punk band from Minneapolis in the late 70&rsquo;s-early 80&rsquo;s.  The lead singer was in high school when the band started. She bangs piano and has the sexiest voice.'

Made up of Andrew, Andy, Graham, Matt, and Sabrina; **A Giant Dog is a group of friends.** But, it's a group of friends who love to rock. Most of the bandmates have been friends since high school. They began A Giant Dog in the fall of 2008, stemming from long time friendships and a couple of high school band attempts. More specifically, A Giant Dog was formed in Austin where Andrew and Sabrina spent a summer on a rooftop on the East Side drinking wine and writing songs.

**So why the name A Giant Dog**? Because Andrew takes pleasure in creating awkward situations for other people. He wanted a non-sequitur name that contained an indefinite article.

But where do they gather inspiration from? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_White" target="_blank">Jack White</a> has been a huge influence;  whetting their appettites for Delta blues and classic Country. A few other musical influences include <strong>Etta James</strong>, <strong>Randy Newman</strong>, <strong>The Beatles</strong>, <strong>Sam Cooke</strong> and <strong>Gino Washington</strong>. Coincidentally, they are also inspired by washing machines, paintings, record players, the squeal of the shower pipes, impulsive behavior, cynicism, and loss.

So, what are they up to when they are not making music? In their own words: **eating meat and making love.**
